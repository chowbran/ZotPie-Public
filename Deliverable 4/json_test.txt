program currently unfinished. TODO: testing and final adjustments


Bugs:
	It doesnt check for rwx permissions at init
	
Poor code logic:

Missing Documentation:
	No documentation in init()
	need comments in getRecords()
	need comments in getGroups()
	need comments in jsonKeyGetter()
	need comments in config()
	need comments in get Collections()
	
Unreadable code: N/A

Vulnerabilities In Code:
	bad style: declares self.zot in config() instead of  __init__()
	bad style: declares variables outside of class
	line 66: if key == 'n/a' - a workaround to work with gui should
		be commented properly because if another program uses this function
		it risks breaking the code
	jsonFileUpdater() line 102, 113, and 115 open files but never close them 

Poor Testing:
	some testing was done in __main__ and that code was not removed, 
	test code that was left in __main__ could have easily been done in unit test code.
